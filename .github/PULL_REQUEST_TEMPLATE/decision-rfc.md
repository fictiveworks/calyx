name: Decision RFC
about: Request comments on a decision or proposed change to Calyx
title: '000: <title>'
---

## Summary

<!--
A brief, one or two sentence explanation of the proposal.
-->

## Context & Motivation

<!--
Include any useful background detail that that explains why this decision is important.
What is the current situation? What needs to change? Why now?
-->

## Goals

<!--
A concise unordered list outlining specific and concrete goals for this proposal.

- What are the exact problems that you are trying to solve with this RFC?
- Separate these goals from the solution that you will outline below.
- If this RFC isn't approved, these goals can be used to develop alternative solutions.
-->

## Non-Goals

<!--
Outline anything intentionally left out of this proposal:

- Non-goal: A goal that is intentionally not addressed in this RFC.
- Out-of-scope: A goal that is related, but intentionally avoided here.
- Future: A goal that is related, but left to be addressed in the future.

This provides a record of what is intentionally left out of scope.
-->

## Detailed Design

<!--
Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Calyx to understand,
and for somebody familiar with one or more platform codebases to implement. This should
get into specifics and edge-cases.

Where relevant, include examples of how the feature is used.

Any new terminology should be defined here.
-->

## Testing Strategy

<!--
How will this feature's implementation be tested? Explain if this can be tested with
unit tests or integration tests or something else. If relevant, explain the test
cases that will be added to cover all of the ways this feature might be used.
-->

## Drawbacks & Tradeoffs

<!--
Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- Implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity.
- Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space.
- Impact on new users of Calyx and beginners/non-experts
- Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- Cost of migrating existing existing clients (_is it a breaking change?_)
- Cost of implementing this across the different platforms we support

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?
-->

## Adoption strategy

<!--
Please consider:

- If we implement this proposal, how will existing Calyx users adopt it?
- Is this a breaking change? Should we document an upgrade path or provide a converter?
- Can we provide a runtime adapter library for the original API it replaces?
- How will this impact the different runtimes and platforms we support?
-->

## Unresolved Questions

<!--
Optional, but suggested for first drafts.
What parts of the design are still to be determined?
